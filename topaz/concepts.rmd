Topaz concepts

    Author: "Gabriele Santilli"
    Purpose: {Some of the ideas I plan to implement in Topaz}

===Introduction

Given that Topaz is proceeding slowly lately, and that there are other
interesting languages coming out such as Red which are still young enough to
allow changes, I thought about publishing this document with some of the ideas
I plan to have in Topaz, so that maybe they can be useful for the other
languages as well.

===Type classes

REBOL 3 introduced type sets as a way to handle pseudo-types like |series!|,
function argument specs, etc. Topaz also supports type sets for the same
reasons, however, they have the disadvantage of being "static", that is, they
don't make sense if the language allows adding new data types at run time.

For example, if you add a new type that behaves like a series, you'll want to
add it to the |series!| typeset; this implies that you know that a |series!|
typeset exists, and that it is mutable and never copied. In the end, this
approach is not going to work, and at best would require type implementers to
do a lot of work.

For this reason, Topaz introduces the concept of type classes. (You may be
familiar with the idea if you have used languages like Haskell etc.) You can
think of a type class as a "dynamic type set". It behaves like a type set,
except that the member types are determined dynamically, by their properties,
rather than listed upon creation of the type set.

For example, a |list!| type class may represent all types that support the
|first| and |next| actions. (Actually, |first| is going to be based on |pick|
in Topaz, but the idea is the same.) If you create a new type that can handle
those two actions, then it is made automatically part of the |list!| type
class, and will be usable by any function that expects a |list!|.

Most "pseudo types", like |series!| etc., in Topaz will be type classes. They
are defined from a list of actions (and possibly "reflectors") that the type
has to support in order to be part of the class.

Note that this implies that the behavior of each action needs to be more
precisely defined to ensure the consistency of the types that are members of
the same type class.

===Object classes

I'm still on the fence on this (because custom types may be a better choice
most of the time), but, they seem a useful enough concept. They work in the
same way as type classes: class membership is not defined statically like in
class-based OOP languages, rather, an object class defines the properties (eg.
fields and their type) that an object must satisfy in order to be part of the
class.

For example, you could say that an |object!| value is part of the |person|
object class if it has two fields, |first-name| and |last-name|, and they are
both set to |string!| values.

===Function classes

In the same spirit as type classes and object classes, function classes define
classes of |function!| values. All functions with the same argument spec (maybe
with some margin for variability, eg. extra options) are part of the same
class.

This is useful when passing arguments that are |function!| values, as the
receiver is usually expecting the argument to behave in a specific way (eg.
take two arguments of a specific type).

===Custom types

It's easy to add new types to Topaz and rebuild the interpreter, but it's still
useful to be able to add new types dynamically at run time as well. The simplest
way to accomplish this is to just "wrap" |object!| values so that they appear
as values of the new custom type. So, under the hood, you're just dealing with
objects, but you can define your own actions for them and have them behave in
any way you wish.

A value of a custom type thus is just a wrapper around an actual |object!|
value which is what your action code will see internally.

===To promise, or not to promise

Like REBOL 3, I/O in Topaz is going to be completely asynchronous. This does
however pose a problem: writing code for async I/O is more complicated than it
needs to be. Since our goal is that simple things should be simple to do, and
complex things possible, complicating the simple cases is not a good idea.

There is a way though to have the benefits of async I/O while keeping code
readable and simple (at least in the simple cases): the concept of promised
values.

The idea is simple: imagine you have something like:

    #lit page: read http://www.colellachiara.com/

With I/O being async, you're usually forced to write it like:

    read http://www.colellachiara.com/ func [page] [...]

which gets really ugly really fast. Instead, what can be done is having |read|
return a "promise" for the page instead of the page itself, so you still write:

    #lit page: read http://www.colellachiara.com/

where |page| is not a |string!| anymore, but a promise for a string to be
delivered later.

A simple (but, insufficient - see below) way to implement this would be to
offer a |promise!| type, and to have a wrapper around functions so that
whenever any one of the arguments is a |promise!|, the function will wait for
it to be resolved (ie. for the actual promised value to be delivered) before
calling the actual function code; the function thus returns immediately a
promise for its result value.

That would make it possible to write something like:

    #lit x: read http://www.colellachiara.com/
    y: read http://www.roccacasale.it/
    z: join x y
    print z

It looks like synchronous code, but everything actually happens asynchronously.
|x| and |y| are promises that are fulfilled in parallel; |z| is a promise for
the result of |join|. Thus, |join| waits until both |x| and |y| are resolved,
then resolves |z| with the result of joining |x| and |y|. |print| waits for |z|
to be resolved, then prints it.

It's nice and works very well, and can be implemented at the mezz level (even
in REBOL 3 for eg.), except for one thing:

    #lit x: none
    page: read http://www.colellachiara.com/
    if find page "Topaz" [
        x: "Found Topaz"
    ]
    print x

Even if |find| and |if| have been adapted to work with promised values, |print|
only sees |none| as its argument here, because the body block of |if| is only
executed when the promise for |page| is resolved.

To solve this problem, the interpreter itself needs to handle cases like this,
and assume that whatever follows the |if| can only be evaluated once the
promise resulting from the |if| is resolved, etc. At that point, though, there
is no need anymore to expose |promise!| values to the user: the interpreter can
handle all this internally, and "pretend" it's evaluating things serially while
actually doing everything in parallel and only serializing based on
dependencies. (A compiler can do more than this, and detect whether the |print|
after the |if| actually needs to wait for the |if| to complete or not.)

There are more issues (eg. correctly serializing writes), but overall the idea
is to have the interpreter doing things in parallel whenever possible
automatically, while you write nice simple code.

===|port!| types

In Topaz, |port!| is a type class, and every different kind of port is its own
type. The reason is that in REBOL ports are the closest thing to custom types,
except that they are specific to one class of types; but, since we have real
custom types in Topaz, there is no need for this special case.
