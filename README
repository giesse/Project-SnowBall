This project is in the boostrap phase, which consists
in developing a minimal Topaz-like compiler in Javascript
(I'm using nodejs actually), with the goal of compiling
a Topaz interpreter written in Topaz (well, a subset of it for now).

More details about Topaz will be available once the bootstrap
is complete.

(Most of the files here are remnants from an initial attempt
at a REBOL implementation of the compiler, but I changed my
mind since then. I'm not removing them since I'll need them
later on.)
