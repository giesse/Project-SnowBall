This project is in the boostrap phase. There's a
minimal Topaz-like compiler written in Javascript
(I'm using nodejs actually), with the goal of compiling
a Topaz interpreter/compiler written in Topaz (well, a subset of it for now).

More details about Topaz will be available once the bootstrap
is complete.

Please ignore the stuff inside old/
